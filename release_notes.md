## Bugs & Fixes

### ✅ Smart Audio Output Detection Fix

**Bug:**  
Previously, users were required to manually select their audio output devices (e.g., speakers, headphones, USB outputs). This created a technical barrier—especially in systems where device names were inconsistent or not recognizable.

**Fix:**  
The application now automatically analyzes available sound output devices using `SoundVolumeView`, detects known output families (like *Speakers*, *Headphones*, *USB Audio*, etc.), and presents the most relevant options to the user. Users still retain the ability to modify their selection if needed.

> This enhancement balances automation with user control, reducing setup friction while keeping customization flexible.

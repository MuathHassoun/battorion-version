# battorion-version

**battorion-version** is a simple configuration repository that stores the application version information for the Battorion project.  
It provides a central place to manage and track the version number used by the software.

The version information is stored in a plain text file in the format `key=value` (e.g., `app.version=7.3.0`), which can be easily read by the application but is intended to be immutable by end users.

This setup helps ensure consistent version management across builds and deployments.
